Create an app, with a single page.
Use this endpoint 'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={search terms}'
and show the results of the GET call.
Implement the page with a search bar and pagination of results

API documentation here: https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/volumes/list
Note: paginated results of google books are not always correct, sometimes there are duplicated elements. Don't worry about it
